# www-hugo: Säkerhetspodcasten's Hugo site

Content, configuration and scripts for our web site.

Depends on:
  * [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - framework for generating static HTML web sites, blogs etc.
  * [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) theme for Hugo.
    * LoveIt theme requires Hugo Extended version, and Hugo 0.62.0 or later.

Personal project.

NOTE:
* **Copyrighted**, all rights reserved, Säkerhetspodcasten.
* Content includes texts written/copyrighted by Johan Rydberg Möller, Peter Magnusson, and others.
* You are free to be inspired by this project, if it in any way is helpful to you. 
  Hugo isn't 100% trivial if you are a beginner like us :-)
